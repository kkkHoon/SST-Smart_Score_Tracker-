__Description__:  
This program automatically handles the score by judging the movement of the balls

as the input value and display it on the video.  
  
The following information can be displayed on the video.
* Scoreboard
* Game progress time
* FPS information
* A line representing the movement of the ball
* The state of the recognized balls (motion / stop / presence)
* Set boundary

These videos can also be saved as video files for each cue.
